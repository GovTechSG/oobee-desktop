# Oobee

Oobee (formerly known as Purple A11y) is an accessibility site scanner - a customisable, automated web accessibility testing tool that allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility problems to improve persons with disabilities (PWDs) access to digital services. The official application can only be downloaded at [https://go.gov.sg/oobee](https://go.gov.sg/oobee). We recommend that you download the software only from the official link, as other sources and/or third party links may pose risks and/or compromise your system.

For software engineers who wish to run Oobee as a command line, please refer to [Oobee (CLI)](https://github.com/GovTechSG/oobee) instead.

## Technology Stack

2. [React](https://react.dev/)

## Installations

### Download Oobee

Oobee is available as a download for Windows and MacOS. Refer to [Installation Guide](/INSTALLATION.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Development, Build and Testing

#### NodeJS Requirement
- Node LTS (22.19.0) is recommended.  The `npm` and `node` command is assumed to be available in `PATH`.
- 
#### Set Engine Version

First open terminal and navigate to the location of clone respository of Oobee.
Then set environment variable BE_TAG to set version of Oobee CLI Portable to be downloaded (see below).  Replace the version of BE_TAG `0.10.68` with the desired version.

#### Build Standalone App

##### For Mac

```shell
npm install
export BE_TAG=0.10.68
npm run make-mac
```

This will create a folder in your repository in the _out_ folder.
Enter and run the `Oobee.app` in the newly created folder in ../out.

##### For Windows

```shell
npm install -g win-node-env
npm install
$env:BE_TAG=0.10.68
npm run make-win
```

##### Special information about Windows build
- The Mac dev app includes a zipped Oobee backend when built using `npm run make-mac` process. When Oobee.app is run in the Setting Up screen, it first checks if the bundled `oobee-portable-mac.zip` version of Oobee the version to be unzipped.  If it does not match, it unzips `Oobee.app/Contents/oobee-portable-mac.zip` to the `~/Library/Application Support/Oobee/Oobee Baclemd`.
- The Windows dev app does not include the Oobee backend. It assumes the location of Oobee (CLI) Portable is already unzipped in `C:\Program Files\Oobee Desktop\Oobee Backend` or `%APPDATA%\Oobee Desktop\Oobee Backend`.

#### Run and Debug (Development)

The dev command is provided below so that a user can debug the Oobee app with STDOUT logs in the Terminal.

Run the code below to build Oobee.

##### For Mac

```shell
npm install
npm run make-mac
```

##### For Windows
```shell
npm install -g win-node-env
npm install
npm run build
```

##### Run the Dev App
